I've been working as a developer for just over 4 years now
both on backend and frontend

Currently, I just finished working as a full-stack rails/react developer
with a company called Vyrill, which is an online Video Search & Analytics application that matches influencers and video content with businesses

The technologies I used included Ruby on Rails, react and its ecosystem, I mean react, router, redux, axios, hooks, apis

I was responsible for creating new functionalities
fix a bunch of pre-existing issues
update old versions of the application to the latest
copy functionalities of the old application to one with react

Before Vyrill I worked with an insurance company service company called GNP Seguros
